Hi there,
I am just a text file, nothing interesting to see here. I contain only boring ASCII characters, which is a
good thing because if I didn't, then you might not be able open me. If you felt like opening me on your
Thumby you could use Reader.py. It's not very good, but it works as long as your longest word is only 12
characters long. If you did decide to open me with Reader.py, you could scroll through me using the d-pad
and when you get bored of me, you could leave by pressing A/B. By the way I noticed you can't open me with
the Thumby emulator, but I can open on a real Thumby.
Sincerely,
Josh the Text File
